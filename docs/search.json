It was originally called the”Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” (now referred to as the “USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee”). The study initially involved 600 Black men – 399 with syphilis, 201 who did not have the disease.

The study will allow us to explore longstanding injustices, consider ethical practices in historical contexts, and explore the sociology of statistics. More specifically, we will use this case to understand the history of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and discuss concepts related to scientific racism. These explorations will help in two key ways: first, we will come to understand what it can mean to be critical in the context of statistics and, second, we will be prepared to respond to problems focused on main concepts in the first few weeks of our course. We will then formalize a few terms.\n\nFraming a relationship between ethics and statistics\nThe “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” (now referred to as the “USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee”) took place in Macon County, Alabama, in an area known as the “Black Belt” because of its rich soil and vast number of Black sharecroppers who were the economic backbone of the region. The research took place at the Tuskegee Institute.\n\nPurpose of the study\nThe intent of the study was to record the natural progression of syphilis in Black men. The study was related to a 1928 retrospective study, the “Oslo Study of Untreated Syphilis,” which reported on the pathological manifestations of untreated syphilis in several hundred white males. However, this original study used secondary data to piece together findings. When the study was initiated in the U.S., there were no proven treatments for the disease. Researchers told the men participating in the study that they were to be treated for “bad blood.” This term had been used by local community members to describe a host of ailments that could be diagnosed including things like anemia, fatigue, and syphilis.\n\nStudy participants\nA total of 600 men were enrolled in the study.\n\nOf this group 399, who had syphilis were a part of the experimental group, and 201 were control subjects.\nMost of the men were poor and illiterate sharecroppers from the county.\nThe participants were offered medical care and insurance.\nThey were enrolled in the study with incentives as well, including medical exams, rides to and from the clinics, meals on examination days, free treatment for minor ailments and guarantees that provisions would be made after their deaths in terms of burial stipends paid to their survivors.\n\n\nEthical issues\n\n\nThere were no proven treatments for syphilis when the study began in 1932.\nWhen penicillin became the standard treatment for the disease in 1947 the medicine was withheld as a part of the treatment for both the experimental group and control group.\nOn July 25, 1972, Jean Heller of the Associated Press broke the story that appeared in both New York and Washington, that there had been a 40-year non-therapeutic experiment called “a study” on the effects of untreated syphilis on Black men in the rural South.\nBetween the start of the study in 1932 and 1947, the date when penicillin was determined as a cure for the disease, dozens of men had died and their wives, children and untold number of others had been infected.\nThere was evidence that scientific research protocol routinely applied to human subjects was either ignored or deeply flawed to ensure the safety and well-being of the men involved. Specifically, the men were never told about or offered the research procedure called informed consent.\n\n\n\nResearchers had not informed the men of the actual name of the study, its purpose, and potential consequences of the treatment or non-treatment that they would receive during the study. The men never knew of the debilitating and life-threatening consequences of the treatments they were to receive, the impact on their partners and children they may have conceived once involved in the research. The panel also concluded that there were no choices given to the participants to quit the study when penicillin became available as a treatment and cure for syphilis. Reviewing the results of the research the panel concluded that the study was “ethically unjustified.” The panel articulated all the above findings in October of 1972 and then one month later the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs officially declared the end of the Tuskegee Study.\n\nClass-Action Suit\nIn the summer of 1973, Attorney Fred Gray filed a class-action suit on behalf of the men in the study, recognized partners, children, and families. It ended a settlement giving more than $9 million to the study participants. Despite these reparative measures, the effects remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted by the U.S Public Health Service was only one of many other past abuses that included unethical experimentation on marginalized groups. As a result of these injustices, a set of mandates were instituted and policies are governed under the IRB, which define the rules and regulations for the approval of research activities. Other countries have equivalent measures focused on ethics.\nAdditional details about can be found online.\nLearn more at https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline."

As we explore new terms and definitions, we will gain a better understanding of what statistics encompasses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITION: Statistics\n\n\n\nStatistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, communicating, and visualizing data and information.\n\n\nThere are a multitude of ways to describe the steps, terms, and various processes undertaken in a statistical study. Importantly, statistics calls for questions where we explore difference or change. We use variation to understand differences within or between a set (or sets) of measurements.\n\n\nWhat should it mean to be critical in the context of statistics?\nOn Canvas, in the Week 2 folder, there is a document titled “Critical Thinking” by Jennifer Duncan. This document is one example of how we can frame what it could or should mean to be critical in statistics. Please review this document.\n\n\nUsing a higher order of thinking. Duncan emphasizes that critical thinking is a higher order of thinking with different advanced thinking skills, and offers a few suggestions.\n\nWe base our thinking on logic and not on feelings.\nWe should look deeper into inferences for hidden assumptions or values.\nAsk complex questions that help build a critical inquiry.\n\n\n\n\nAsking complex questions. Duncan breaks down the process into a few sub-questions.\n\nWho is the implied audience?\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument?\nWhat are the underlying assumptions and values?\n\n\n\n\nUsing a variety of thinking processes. Duncan defines a process around analyzing, synthesizing, interpreting, and evaluating information that helps with our thinking.\n\n\n\nReflecting on how we answer a question. Duncan ends with a set of questions that help us think about different points of view, if we have clarity, and if more details are needed."

This homework is ungraded, and while there is no prerequisite for this course, homework 0 (hw-0) should serve as a review and a preview of content that we’ll explore for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions.\nExercise 0.1. If an individual’s projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a “rational agent” prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a “rational agent”? Explain why the “rational agent” would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources.\nExercise 0.2. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution.\nExercise 0.3. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here?\nI will not collect hw-0 but I am happy to review it if you’d like; upload it to Canvas here.\n\n\nLab 0\nFor your first lab, you will install two software programs on your local machine: the first is base R and the second is the RStudio Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Both programs are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must download both R and RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete assignments, you must download base R and RStudio to your computer.\n\n\n\nRStudio is now called Posit. When you are searching online you will begin to see language differences.\nIt can all get very confusing. In order to reduce confusion, I am requesting that you watch this short tutorial so that we’re all on the same page. I will discuss this more when we meet.\n\n\nNext up: Computing\nOn the next page, I will walk you through downloading the appropriate software for our work this term."

    "text": "Some guidance on doing an  annotated bibliography \n\nPurpose\nEvery research paper should include a relevant literature review. Literature reviews can help your readers understand the need for your study, outline a paper’s central thesis, and support readers in making sense of closely related results and findings. As a result, literature reviews can come in many different lengths and formats.\nDoing a literature review is similar to doing any kind of research. A literature review should identify a central question, methodology, and also report findings. One effective way to start a literature review is to create an annotated bibliography.\nPrior to starting an annotated bibliography, it is useful to develop a question that will help you explore and better understand theoretical and methodological connections.\n\n\nFraming a question\nLiterature reviews, like most research projects, can begin from a basic question.\n\nDoes income relate to the availability of resources for [a population]?\nAre years of experience for [a sample] related to their perceptions of power?\n\nOnce you have identified a suitable question, you can use keywords to find sources for an annotated bibliography. The library website can be used to search periodicals or sources like the ERIC system, and you can also utilize popular search engines that house similar works, such as Research Rabbit and Google Scholar.\n\n\nAnnotated bibliographies\nAn annotated bibliography is a list of sources about a specific research question or topic. Each source contains a short statement about the contents of the source (e.g., research paper, online article, or other scholarly and/or published works). Annotated bibliographies are not abstracts, although their length and structure may be similar.\nEach source included in an annotated bibliography should begin with an appropriate citation of the source (in APA, MLA, or Chicago style) and a brief description of the purpose and contents of the source, as well as an evaluation or reflection. The inclusion of an evaluation or reflection when summarizing a published source is one effective way to tell the difference between the abstract and the annotation.\nView samples of annotated bibliographies."

M., ca. 1919) to the top-left of the screen.\nAs you may know, it is a photo of W. E. B. Du Bois1, who is one of the many researchers, activists, and community organizers that will help guide our statistical practices this term. Using their examples, we make sense of theories around the phenomenon of “social justice,” and we use statistics to theorize.\nThe pages on this site outline the coding components of the DATA 202: Statistically Measuring and Modeling Social Justice course at Howard University, taught by me: Professor Nathan Alexander.\nThe information on this page will serve as a technical companion to our Canvas site.\nThis page will support you in our course in the following ways:\n\nThis page will help you work with data sets and complete small tasks over time.\nThis page will walk you through the measurement aspect of research questions relevant to modeling issues of social justice.\nThis page will help you integrate mathematical ideas and technical formulas into your work.\nThis page will support your use of theory in your statistical practice, and increase your ability to document reproducible code around a set of research questions.\n\nOur canvas site (click here) contains readings and is where you will submit all assignments.\nThis site should be paired with Canvas to help you complete course assignments.\nAnd just for good measure: all assignments should be turned in via Canvas.\nWhen turning in assignments on Canvas:\n\nGenerally, PDF submissions are the way to go.\nI will not download any files not uploaded to Canvas. I will only click on a clearly visible Github repository (i.e., no shortened or bit.ly links). Article citations that include DOIs are preferred.\nWe will discuss Quarto Markdown files which integrate code, formulas, and text. Quarto is actually how I created this site for our course, and it is a great way to communicate your technical ideas.\nThis is a Canvas companion site/page (I’ll use these terms interchangeably) and it will serve as your guide to completing all technical assignments.\n\n\n\n It is alive!\nThis is a living document, meaning that more materials will be added as topics are introduced. It is important that you check these pages regularly. You should also use this course organization as an archive of any technical code that is covered in class. Canvas contains readings and this page will integrate code.\n\n\nJust a reminder.\nCanvas contains readings. This site integrates code. All submissions go to Canvas: here.\n\n\nNext up: Overview\nThe overview in the next section will walk you through the technical flow of the course.\nLike this section, a preview of forthcoming topics will be included at the bottom of each page; this means that you can treat this site like a textbook that you would read in order from start to finish. Though I encourage you to explore what else is out there and make use of other resources. That said, submissions should follow the formal guidelines outlined on our syllabus, Canvas, and this site.\n\nThe syllabus provides a high-level view of the course.\nCanvas is the go-to for submissions and provides readings and assignments.\nThis course site provides technical items and code to help you complete your assignments.\n\nComing up next are the four parts of the course and an overview of the assignments for the term. Course topics are outlined in more detail and integrated into the assignment submission schedule on the next page; see you over there!"

Given the title and contents of the data set, it includes population data for the world’s countries for the given years.\nExercise 1.9.\n\nCountry 1: 2.06139E8 = 206139000\nCountry 2: 8.9561E7 = 89561000\nCountry 3: 2.77E7 = 27700000\nCountry 4: 2.72815E5 = 272815\nCountry 5: 6.077E3 = 6077\n\n\n\nHomework 0 Solutions\nExercise 0.1. If an individual’s projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a “rational agent” prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a “rational agent”? Explain why the “rational agent” would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources. Solution not provided.\nExercise 0.2. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution. Solution outlined in the bullets below.\n\nAn integer value \\(x\\) is any number in the set of numbers known as the integers. This set includes: zero, \\(0\\); the natural numbers, \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}\\); and the additive inverses (opposites) of the values in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), or the set of values \\(\\{..., -3, -2, -1 \\}\\).\nTogether these three sets make up the integers, \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... \\}\\).\nThe sum of the first 100 positive integers is equivalent to asking for the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.\nA short explanation of the solution is provided below:\n\nAssume that we have a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Let’s add them up and call the sum \\(S\\):\n\\[ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 + 100 \\]\nNow, assume we reverse the order of the sum, \\(S\\), to get the following:\n\\[ S = 100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 2 + 1 \\]\nIf we add these two sums up, we should get something similar to the line below:\n\\[ 2S = (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (99 + 2) + (100 + 1) \\]\nIt is important that you see what was done in the line above; try writing it out yourself!\n\\[ 2S = 101 + 101 + 101 + ... + 101 + 101 \\]\nSolving for S in the above equation, we get the following:\n\\[ S = \\dfrac{100(101)}{2} = 5050\\]\nThe sum, \\(S\\), is equal to 5050, which is the solution; try generalizing the sum for any case.\n\n\nExercise 0.3. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here? Answers will vary."
