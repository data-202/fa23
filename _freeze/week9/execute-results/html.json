We will begin with an example.\n\n---\n\n### Crime statistics\n\nData from 1973 on violent crime rates by US State in the `USArrests` data set.\n\nValues are per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(USArrests)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nAlabama      13.2     236       58 21.2\nAlaska       10.0     263       48 44.5\nArizona       8.1     294       80 31.0\nArkansas      8.8     190       50 19.5\nCalifornia    9.0     276       91 40.6\nColorado      7.9     204       78 38.7\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(USArrests)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nVermont          2.2      48       32 11.2\nVirginia         8.5     156       63 20.7\nWashington       4.0     145       73 26.2\nWest Virginia    5.7      81       39  9.3\nWisconsin        2.6      53       66 10.8\nWyoming          6.8     161       60 15.6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(USArrests$UrbanPop, USArrests$Murder)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.06957262\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(USArrests$UrbanPop, USArrests$Murder,\n     xlab = \"Percent living in urban areas\",\n     ylab = \"Murders per 100,000 residents\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat are some initial takeaways from this plot?\n\nWithout a guiding theory, where might our analyses take us?\n\n---\n\n### Small group work\n\nIn your groups, consider the values in the `USArrests` data and generate some questions.\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Content\n\nThe methods used to collect sample data is extremely important. \n\nIf sample data are not collected in an appropriately, any resulting statistical analyses will be futile. As a result, planning a study by identifying research questions, the population and sample of interest, and considering the types of methods that will be used to analyze data that is collected are all essential parts in the statistical data analysis process.\n\n---\n\n#### More on sampling methods\n\nFirst, let's revisit and describe the different sampling methods:\n\nThere are two broad categories of selecting members of a population to generate sample data: probability sampling and non-probability sampling. \n\nWithin these two broad categories are other methods based on the needs of the study. Each of these methods is used to support statistical data analysis with some methods providing stronger evidence than others.\n\n::: callout-DEFINITIONS\n\nProbability sampling\n\n:   involves the random selection of subjects in such a way that every member of a sample has the sample probability of being selected.\n\nNon-probability sampling\n\n:   involves the use of criteria to select data that is not based on an equal likelihood of selection.\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n##### Probability sampling methods\n\n-   **Simple random sample** of $n$ subjects ensures that every possible sample of the same size $n$ has the same chance or likelihood of being chosen.\n\n-   **Systematic sample** of $n$ subjects involves selecting every $k$th subject on some regular interval.\n\n-   **Stratified sample** involves dividing the population up into strata (groups) with the same characteristics and then randomly sampling within those strata.\n\n-   **Cluster sample** involves partitioning the population into clusters (groups), randomly selecting some clusters, and then selecting all members of the selected clusters.\n\n---\n\n##### Non-prbability sampling methods\n\n-   **Convenience sample** is data gathered from the most accessible or convenient source. Although this is easy and efficient, the data cannot produce generalizable results.\n\n-   **Purposive sample** is data gathered based on the purposes of the research or the specific research question. This strategy includes clear criteria and rationale for inclusion.\n\n-   **Snowball sample** is data gathered via recruitment by the other participants of a study. The number of subjects included \"snowballs\" as more contacts are generated.\n\n---\n\n###### Multistage sampling\n\nIn larger studies, sometimes multistage sampling procedures are used to generate data. In this design, different samples are selected in different stages, and each stage might use a different sampling method. The end result may represent a complicated sampling design but it is often simpler and faster than some designs, such as a simple random sample.\n\n---\n\n**Missing Data**\n\nData can be missing from a set, and the total number of elements can differ between two or more sets. \n\nThe differences in the number of elements can be due to a host of reasons, but often it is missing data. A data value can be _missing at random_ or _not missing at random_. The amount of information missing from a data set can have a minimal impact or a major impact on a statistical analysis.\n\n::: {.callout-note apperance=\"simple\"}\n\n## **Note -- Missing data**\n\nA data value is _missing completely at random_ if the likelihood of it being missing is independent of its value or any other values in the data set is just as likely to be missing.\n\n\nA data value is _not missing at random_ if the missing value is related to the reason it is missing.\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Part III: Code\n\nOur coding tasks this week will focus on a new data set: [the General Social Survey, or GSS](https://gss.norc.org/).\n\nWe will begin by installing a few new packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## install new packages\ninstall.packages(\"srvyr\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\ninstall.packages(\"statsr\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we will load the libraries.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(descr)\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(survey)\nlibrary(srvyr)\nlibrary(statsr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo access the GSS data, we will need to use a remote install command.\n\nThe data come from the `GSSR` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install GSSR data\nremotes::install_github(\"kjhealy/gssr\")\nlibrary(gssr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will now load the GSS documentation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(gss_doc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nView the GSS documentation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(gss_doc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will pick up from here with live coding in class.\n\n### **Next up**: Week 10\n",
