For Lab 4, you may submit your solutions to Canvas as a `.pdf` or an *R Script* or even as a `.txt` file.

Please see the *Preparing Lab Reports* at the bottom of the [lab 1](labs/lab1.qmd) assignment.

## Learning Objectives

The `Lab 4` assignment focuses on you exploring multiple variables located in gssr.

Your inquiry in this lab should focus on a *multivariate regression analysis*.

**Please note: you may use the same variables from a previous assignment but please use different questions.**

Importantly, your analysis in lab 4 should inform the paper 4 assignment.
